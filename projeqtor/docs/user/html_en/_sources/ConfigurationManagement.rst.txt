Configuration Management
########################


Configuration management consists of managing the technical description of a system, as well as managing all changes made during the evolution of the system.

It is the set of processes to ensure the conformity of a product to the requirements, throughout its life cycle.

In computing, for example, configuration management can be used for many purposes.

* To store and trace the different versions or revisions of any information intended to be used by a system (hardware, software, document, unit data, etc.).
* To deploy configurations through a computer park in the form of files and data.
* Manage source codes ...

Select one or more product versions and the planning version is displayed.

This planning displays each version of selected product versions and their components from define start date to deliverable date.

To use it define your start and delivery date in Product Version and Component Version.
   
.. note:: 

   To insert values you have to activate display the start and delivery milestonesâ€™ in global parameters otherwise these fields are hidden.

This screen allows to see if the delivery date of Component versions is more later than their Product versions. 

Graphically, you can see any delay or incompatibility.

New check boxes will appear: one to show resources and the other to show or hide versions with no activity displayed.

You must select an existing activity to insert the new activity into the WBS structure.

If no activity is selected then the "add new element" icon will be grayed out.

The new activity is automatically inserted after the selected activity.

The new activity is generated on the same project, with the same component, the same component version, and with the same product and the same product version if these elements are filled in on the original activity.

The insertion from the selection of a product and component version will not be possible because we do not know where to insert it in the WBS of the projects.
